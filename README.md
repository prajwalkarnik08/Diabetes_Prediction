# Diabetes_Prediction

Diabetes Dataset This dataset contains all the patients who are females of atleast 21 years of age of Indian heritage. I have taken this dataset from Kaggle. The features in this dataset are:

1) Pregnencies: It tells the number of times the female is pregnent.

2) Glucose: It gives the amount of Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.

3) Blood Pressure: It is Diastolic blood pressure measured in (mm Hg = millimeters of mercury).

4) Skin Thickness: It tells the amount of fat measured in triceps skin fold thickness in (mm).

5) Insulin: It is 2-hour serum insulin measured in (mu U/ml). Insulin is a hormone that lowers the level of glucose in the blood.

6) BMI: It is Body Mass Index. It is the ratio of weight in kg(kilograme) to the square of height in m(meter).

7) Diabetes Pedigree function: It is a function that scores the probability of diabetes based on family history, with a realistic range from 0.08 to 2.42.

8) Age: Age of the female which starts from 21.

9) Outcome: It consists of binary variable 0 and 1. 0 represents the healthy people and 1 represents those with diabetes.

I have done data collection and pre-processing ---> Exploratory Data Analysis ---> Detected Outliers ---> Built Support Vector Regression model ---> Evaluated the model based on accuracy score on the train and test data ---> Made a Predictive system that can suggest whether a female has diabetes or not.
